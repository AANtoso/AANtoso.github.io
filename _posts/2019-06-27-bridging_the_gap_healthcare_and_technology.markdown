The worlds of healthcare and technology are very different. However, healthcare now uses EMR (electronic medical records) to chart on patients. EMR has made everything easier to keep track of. There are still some setback with EMR. But overall, it has made daily life at the hospital so much smoother.

Until, you are getting a transfer patient from another healthcare agency or system. EMRs don't have the ability to "talk to each other". What I mean by this is, they can't share or relay information to each other. Part of this is due to HIPPA rules. The other part is due to the fact that they use different applications and EHR platforms. 

Why is this a problem?
When we are getting a transfer patient, we get "word-of-mouth" report. However, this does not always give us the complete history of the patient. More often than we would like to admit, information is left out or "wrongly reported". This, in turn, leads to healthcare errors. The healthcare errors, unfortunately (depending on what the error involved), can lead to patients ending up in critical condition, or even death.

The occurrence of these errors can be lessened which is why I wanted to get into Software Engineering. I would like to be a part of an innovation team that creates am app that is able to transfer EMRs from one hospital to another.
