My interest in coding stemmed from my interest in how computers functioned. Anytime I went to the Apple store to get something fixed or a technical issue looked at, they always opened my terminal. I never knew what it was for or what they were doing with it, but I always found it fascinating that they could look at it and "decipher what it was saying in terms of what the problem involved.

Since I started this course, I have realized how similar coding it to learning a foreign language. I still struggle with reading syntax errors and understanding all of the different terms and what each function does, but in due time, things will start to make more sense. I find myself chatting with classmates about struggles and it definitely helps knowing that we can all help each other through this journey.

On Friday during a pair programming session with a classmate, I asked if he know if there was an easier way to break down what iterations do. I found it really helpful as this is a concept that I struggle with very much.

```
def square_array(array)
  new_numbers = []
  array.each { |numbers_element| new_numbers << numbers_element * numbers_element }
  new_numbers
end
```

Doing my best to explain this code: The method square_array is taking in the argument of an array. new_numbers is an empty array. array.each is calling each element of the array and iterating over them, pushing the square of each element. new_numbers is calling the squares of each of the new_numbers array.

I am still uncomfortable with explaining iteration and code in general, but, trying my best to understand and be able to regurgitate my understanding.
